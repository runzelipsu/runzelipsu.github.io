Summary of research interests</h4>
Li is interested in the fields of variable selection, local modeling, functional
data analysis and designs of experiment. His primary research focuses on
the topics of variable selection and local modeling.&nbsp;
<p>Variable selection is fundamental to statistical modeling. Many approaches
in use are stepwise selection procedures, such as best subset variable
selection and stepwise backward elimination, which can be expensive in
computation and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process.
In Li’s works, new approaches are proposed to select significant variables
for various statistical models. Based on penalized likelihood, the proposed
approaches delete insignificant covariates by estimating their coefficients
to be zero, and therefore simultaneously select significant variables and
estimate parameters. It has shown in his works that the proposed approaches
have oracle properties, namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel
were known.
<p>Li is also interested in the topic of functional data analysis. Functional
data is also called as curve data. In fact, longitudinal data, repeated
measurements and growth curves are special cases thereof.&nbsp; In his
work, local likelihood methodology was used to deal with efficient estimation
for various nonparametric models. Further, nonparametric maximum likelihood
ratio type of goodness of fit test is proposed for nonparametric regression
models used in functional data analysis.
