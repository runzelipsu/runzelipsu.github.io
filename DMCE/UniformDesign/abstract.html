<P>Statistical design of experiments, while popular in many disciplines,
originated with agricultural applications in the 1920's.&nbsp; This paper
discusses the fundamental ideas behind various branches of design of experiments.&nbsp;
This includes treatment allocation, multiple comparisons, blocking, combinatorics,
response surface methodology, and the following types of designs: fractional
factorials, ANOVA-type, optimal, bayesian, Taguchi, mixture, uniform, supersaturated,
and other related designs.&nbsp; Relationships among them will be described.&nbsp;
Through these relationships, it is hoped that we can generated future research
ideas on design of experiments.&nbsp; This seems to be particularly important
for the information technology era we are currently in and that can be
expected to continue for decades.

Three major methods of experimental design, such as factorial design including
fractional factorial design and orthogonal design, D-optimal design and
uniform design, and their applications in chemistry and chemical engineering
are reviewed and compared.&nbsp; The features of uniform design are specially
addressed.&nbsp; Several different cases applying uniform design to chemical
research showed that the uniform design is a very promising and powerful
experimental design method.&nbsp; Uniformity of space filling is the most
important and essential feature of the uniform design.&nbsp; Based on this
feature, its cost-efficiency, robustness and flexibility make it very useful
in chemistry and chemical engineering.

points.&nbsp; Obviously, repeated experiments increase the budget and time
of the experiments, but give in general better estimation of parameters
in the underlying model.&nbsp; Is it necessary to have duplicates in experimental

<CENTER><B>On Uniform Design and Knowledge Discovery in Database and Data
Mining</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Qian jin</I></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>(Zhongnan University of Finance and Economics, Wuhan, P.R.C)</I></CENTER>


<P>When uniform design (UD) is used to solve an optimization problem, a
set of uniform distributed points in the test area is produced based on
the Number Theorem ( NTM). Usually the number of points is very large,
for example, to do an experiment for a problem with S factors and Q levels,
S! possible selections are produced and Q<SUP>S</SUP> records are written
into the database. Knowledge discovery in database (KDD) and data mining
(DM) is another technique for optimization, it discovers the rich knowledge
from the experiment data, so it is better to combine these two methods
in solving optimization problems. In this paper a case study is presented
by using the joined method. In this study, the joined method is applied
to the problem of material mix in designing the deep-water leakage-proof
cofferdam in the Three Gorge Project. The UD method is used to do 10 experiments
and the data from the experiments are used to train a neural network, then
two mix results are obtained. It has been verified that the result is satisfactory.
This shows the ability of NTM-based UD method to simplify optimization
problems and extract useful information. At the same time, if the UD is
not combined with Artificial Neural Network (ANN), then the solution can
only be selected among the data groups 6, 7 and 8, which is worse than
the obtained one and cannot meet the requirement in respect to1995's standard.
In this case study, by using ANN, 900 data groups are "mined out" from
the 10 data "mineral deposit", so two satisfactory solutions are "discovered".
These solutions produce the mix for the flexible material that meets the
mechanics requirement under the water of 100 meters. This shows important
role played by the technique of KDD &amp; DM in UD applications.
<BR>In Fang, Wang 1996, [3] it is pointed out that in optimization NTM
makes great challenge to other methods including simulated annealing method
(SAM). Thus, it gives rise to a question that can we use UD to conduct
the ANN to make knowledge discovery?
<BR>In the past 20 years, regression model is widely used to analyze the
data produced by UD experiments. In this way, less than one tenth of KDD
&amp; DM is used. We use UD to conduct DELPHI polling, with four factors
considered and six exports selected , 24 tables of U<SUB>6</SUB> (6<SUP>4</SUP>)
can be produced. By using the method proposed by the author of this paper
in [9], a database be called UD database with 6<SUP>4</SUP> = 1296 records
is produced. By using the criteria of extenics and based on the practical
applications, we can select a set of solutions for consideration.

Xie and Fang (1999) considered the problem of nonparametric experimental
design and pointed out that the uniform design measure is an admissible
minimax design under a certain sense.&nbsp; For the case of one variable
(or factor), in this paper the uniform design is employed to the arrangement
for the nonparametric experiment, and three fitted models (polynomial,
Fourier and wavelet) are borrowed to the analysis of experimental data.&nbsp;
Simulation shows that wavelet model possesses a better performance under

<P>The researches of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have achieved remarkably
wide application and development since its revival in the 1980's. But the
characteristic feature -- the abilities of strong learning, strong adaptation,
large scale parallel processing, have not been shown obviously. The learning
capacity and generalization capacity of ANN are not satisfactory. Yet,
its adaptive abilities is weak and it is difficulty to construct networks.
As a result, the two major problem in ANN engineering application are researching
the optimization design of the topology structure of networks and efficient
learning algorithm.
<BR>The structure design of ANN mainly depended on experience and repeated
experiments, there was not a systematically method to determine the satisfactory
networks structure all along. A kind of heuristic construction algorithm
or prune algorithm to design networks automatically has been proposed during
recent years, but this algorithm is too complicated to be applied. In this
paper, uniform design is used to optimize NN structure design, achieving
a good effect.
<BR>The method of ANN structure optimization design based on uniform design
is introduced in this paper, making use of NN detecting pulse compressed
signal as example. Three layers structure of ANN is adopted, which consists
of input layer, hidden layer, one node in output layer. The 13 digits Barker
code signal is taken for input signal, and input layer is acted as classifier.
The output value will approach to 1 on condition that receiving code sequential
signals is pulse compressed signals. As optimizing design, Backpropagation
NN (BP) and Radius Base Function (RBF) NN are adopted respectively, and
the number of units in hidden layer, the learning step and the learning
rate are chose as three factors for design, and learning error as the performance
index.
<BR>The conclusion is derived through the experiment in 7 levels of 3 factors:
both BP NN and RBF NN should employ 52 hidden units and take 20 as learning
rate, 28 as learning step in order to achieve the best effect, that is
to say, the time is the shortest and the error is the smallest .

<BR>Experiment schedules of 6 chemical research subjects were designed
with Orthogonal Design and Uniform Design.&nbsp; The experiment data were
treated by Regression Analysis and Variance Analysis and the mathematics
models based on them were set up accordingly.&nbsp; By the bound solution
of object function, process conditions and formulas&nbsp; were optimized.&nbsp;
This paper describes the experiment schedule design and optimization course
of 3 of the 6 research subjects, presents the practical effect of the others,
and discusses the advantages and disadvantages as well as the questions
that should be paid attention to in the application of Orthogonal Design
and Uniform Design in chemical scientific research.
<BR>The major contributions of this paper are stated as follows:
<UL>
<LI>
In the optimization of process conditions for triacetin synthesis, regression&nbsp;
equations were established&nbsp; by Regression Analysis and Variance Analysis
based on orthogonal bench-scale experiment data, and better process condition
parameters were recommended&nbsp; through the solution of the equation,
providing the pilot experiment a theoretical basis, and the times of pilot
tests were reduced.&nbsp; The better process condition were verified in
the pilot tests. The yield of triacetin was raised by 6%, and reaction
temperature was 15-20<SUP>o</SUP>C lower than that of the bench -- scale
Orthogonal test conditions, so the energy consumption was also reduced.</LI>

<LI>
In the formulas optimization experiment of water quality stabilizer, Uniform
Design was used for the development of the&nbsp; formulas, obtaining satisfactory
results.&nbsp; In condition of high alkalinity, anticorrosive ratio of
the carbon steel sheet was 96.93% when X1&nbsp; 2.30ppm, X2&nbsp; 64.50ppm,
X4&nbsp; 28.03ppm, X5 148.41ppm was added in the experiment solution respectively.&nbsp;
When Uniform Design is used for an experiment having more factors and levels,
a great deal of time and expenses could be saved and work efficiency be
raised.&nbsp; Take this experiment with 5 factors and 11 levels as an example,
at least 121 tests should be done with Orthogonal Design.&nbsp; According
to this experiment, every test cost 3 days, more than one year was needed
for the whole experiment.&nbsp; But actually less than 30 tests were done
by using Uniform Design.&nbsp; Thus, in the design of formulas&nbsp; whose
components don't have clear interaction or interaction mechanism, it is
quite helpful to use Uniform Design and Regression Analysis for the experiment.</LI>

<LI>
There are more factors that affect polymerization experiment, and there
is obvious interaction between each factor.&nbsp; In the optimization experiment
of solution polymerization 25 tests have to be done and the interactions
can not be eliminated if Orthogonal Design is adopted.&nbsp; However, using
Uniform Design can effectively reduce test times and save cost.&nbsp; Pour
inhibitor made according to the improved experiment plan by using Uniform
Design, is equivalent to T602 in viscosity index improvement, better than
T602 in pour inhibition and shear resistance.</LI>

<LI>
In addition, some satisfied achievements were obtained by using Uniform
Design in other projects such as the development of bactericide and the
measuration of microelement in active carbon catalyst by XRF.</LI>

<P>"Uniform design" and optimizing technology are used in the research
of additive component optimization and hence desire results are got quickly.
<BR>When use the technology in emulsifying component optimization, 5 different
compounds are pre-selected as base elements of the promoter for enhancing
the emulsifier and U<SUB>10</SUB><SUP>*</SUP>(10<SUP>8</SUP>) form (applying
form when S=5) is used designing experiment. Adding amount of every element
is used as X<SUB>i </SUB>and dewatering experiment results as Y.&nbsp;
The data are treated with optimization software and the experiential model
is built. According to the direction of the model, new promoter components
are selected and used in the emulsifying experiments. New results are added
to the data and new experiential model is built. After several cycles,
desire promoter is made up and the desire delusion results are got.
<BR>The promoter is blended with two samples of polyethoxy polypropoxy
emulsifier (product name SP169) taking from different producers and the
mixtures are added to the crude oil emulsion. Compare with the demulsifier
without promoter, the dewatering ability increases obviously in the experiments
for two different Liaohe crude. When using promoter 15% in the demulsifying
components (15% promoter and 85% demulsifier), the water contain in the
demulsified crude can be reduced from 6.30% to 2.41% and 2.38% to 2.04%
for two SP169 samples. The promoter cost is much lower than the demulsifier
used in the experiments.
<BR>When use the technology in toluene emulsion project, 4 factors are
examined and the U<SUB>7</SUB> form is used for designing experiment. In
the same way as in the crude demulsion project, after several cycles, stable
toluene-water emulsion is got quickly. Because many different toluene-water
emulsion components can meet the demand, the stable area chart is made
out and the effect of different emulsifying agent on emulsion stability
is clear.

<CENTER><B>Experiment Study of Concrete Filled Steel Square Tubular Columns
under Bias Compression on The Basis of Uniform Design</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>(Shenyang University)</I></CENTER>


<P>The test is an important link for scientific research. It can offer
a large number of evidence and examine if the result of theory analysis
is right. The method of test affects seriously its results. A simple and
definite method is adopted usually.
<BR>The concrete filled steel square tube is a composite material that
the concrete is placed into empty steel tube. It has high compressive strength.
It is suitable to be used as the columns of buildings. This kind of structure
has many advantages. For instance, the weight of a building is only about
50 percent of reinforced concrete structure. The size of a column is merely
30 percent of a reinforced concrete column suffering the same number of
outer load. The construction time is shortened considerably. The amount
of steel required to build equals to that of reinforced concrete structure;
it is about 50 percent of that of steel structure. Thus, the building costs
are reduced on the same condition. The new type of structure has a very
good future of development. So, the performance of every kind of some structural
pieces is needed to investigate next.
<BR>The experiment plan is made using the Uniform Design on concrete filled
steel square tubular columns under bias compressive loading. The number
of specimens is minimized compared to the Orthogonal Design. The data are
more reasonable. A large amount of labor, materials and money is saved.
The equation to calculate the bearing capacity of the columns is deduced.
It compensates the disadvantages of the equation of the ordinary concrete
filled steel tubular columns under bias compressive loading. The discount
coefficient on the basis of short axial columns is given by regression
analysis. It is the function of the ratio between length and radius and
eccentricity. According to the equation of the ordinary concrete filled
steel tubular columns, if the columns have different ratios between length
and radius and the same eccentricity, they have the same bearing capacity.
There is something wrong in theory with this result. It is proved in this
paper. The columns with different ratios between length and radius and
the same eccentricity have different bearing capacity. The calculation
results with this equation are very accurate compared with the experiment
results.
<BR>Through the analysis as above, the Uniform Design method can be used
in structural experiments and it is very convenient.

<P>The instinct features of foam lightweight material are light weight
and cellular structure. The raw materials of the foam material are cement,
sand, foam and others.&nbsp; As the foam existing, every composition of
the raw material shows complex nonlinear relationship to the mechanics
index of the lightweight material.&nbsp; In order to find out the optimum
mix proportion, the experimental design is conducted by application of
uniform design theory.&nbsp; Since the experimental data are too scattered
to analyze by using regression method, neural networks model is adopted
for analyzing experimental result. Back propagation (BP) algorithms neural
networks has very strong capacity of mapping nonlinearity, the artificial
neural networks model is trained by given sample of input and output, so
that it can research a simulate relationship of the input and the output.&nbsp;
The trained network model can forecast the mechanics index of the foam
material in any mix proportion, which have not been experimented.&nbsp;
So, the optimum mix proportion for the engineering request can be found
by means of the trained neural networks model.&nbsp; In a word, this paper
verifies that uniform design theory is reasonable for experimental design
of foam lightweight material, and the neural networks model is practical
and efficient for tackling experimental data with uniform design.

<P>This paper reports a study of the relationship between the driver-vehicle
closed-loop system characteristics and some vehicle parameters such as
vehicle velocity and the cornering stiffness of the front and rear wheels.
By means of the uniform design, the computer experiment for three factors,
vehicle velocity and the cornering stiffness of the front and rear wheels,
is arranged. The regression model of the closed-loop comprehensive index
with respect to the vehicle velocity and the cornering stiffness of the
front and rear wheels is established. The regression model is in the form
of quartic polynomial. Stepwise regression and the L-H algorithm, by which
a better regression subset can be generated, are used to choose the regression
variables. The testing results show that the regression model is highly
significant with the vehicle velocity and the cornering stiffness of the
front and rear wheels adopting their values over a large scale. The regression
model shows that there exist higher-order nonlinear relations among the
closed-loop comprehensive index, the vehicle velocity, and the cornering
stiffness of the front and rear wheels. The higher-order interactions among
the vehicle velocity, the cornering stiffness of the front and rear wheels
also contribute to the closed-loop comprehensive index.

With the development of chemical industry, environment pollution is getting
heavier and heavier.&nbsp; In China, the capability of synetheic detergent
has risen sharply to three million tons pr year, but most of them contains
phosphate and/or borate as auxiliary detergents.&nbsp; Recent years, many
lakes such as Taihu, Dianchi and rivers such as Huaihe have been contaminated
by industrial wastes, large drained waste water containing phosphate ais
one of the most sources.&nbsp; Sodium percarbonate (SPC), as a kind of
auxiliary detergent, performs remarkable functions of blanching, killing
bacterium and cleaning.&nbsp; It has been employed worldwide tyo substitute
for phosphate and borate in artificial detergents.
<BR>At present, the capability of it has reached 700 thousand tons one
year.&nbsp; Since the begining of 1980's, it has been studied, developed
and produced with an increasing year by year.
<BR>The synthetic methods of SPC are divided into dry method and wet method.&nbsp;
The latter is used widelyt home and abroad and the former used gradually
less.&nbsp; But the production of SPC by the wet was needed to control
the reaction temperature below 5<SUP>o</SUP>C, so the processing is complex,
inconvenient and the energy demand is higher.
<BR>The purpose of this investigation is throught adding inorganic and
organic additiives, using Unfirom Design method to imporve the reaction
condition.
<BR>SPC is made from sodium carbonate and aqueous hydrogen peroxide.&nbsp;
The optimum condition are as follows: the molar ratio of sodium carbonate
to hydrogen peroxide is 1/1.7, the amount of organic stabilizer is 55cm<SUP>3</SUP>.,
that of inorganic stabilizer is 0.8g and reaction time is 40 minute, the
most important change is that reaction temperature never need below 5<SUP>o</SUP>C,
the product can be produced at room/ambient tempertaure.&nbsp; Under all
above condition, the highest content of SPC is gained by 88.74%.&nbsp;
The result shows that uniform design is useful for this study.

<P>The preparation conditions of the loading catalyst (cation exchange
resin as carrier) for esterification are studied by using Uniform Design.
The obtained regression equation shows well the metal salt quantity, loading
temperature, loading time and particle size of catalyst carrier effects
on the activity of catalyst for esterification. The loading catalyst prepared
by optimization experiment conditions has high activity. Using as the catalyst
of esterification reaction of ethyl alcohol and acetic acid, the percent
conversion of acetic ether is about 36.56% in one hour as the loading catalyst
quantity is 5% of acetic acid quantity in the reaction system. Compared
with non-loading cation exchange risen as catalyst, the conversion of acetic
ether rose 17.32 percent points in the same reaction conditions.

The uniform device was used to optimize the processing conditions of peamnut
protein former.&nbsp; A model, which describes the relations between foaming
properties and reaction time of enzymatic hydrolysis, amount of used protease,
reaction time of alkaline hydrolysis and amount of used alkali, was obtained
through progressive regression on a quadratic multinomial model.

<P>Uniform design is superior to orthogonal design and optimality design
in their table's usage.&nbsp; Uniform tables are flexible and need not
specific assumptions.&nbsp; The outcomes of uniform design experiments
are analyzed on various assumptions and modern statistical methods.&nbsp;
If the response variables of the outcomes are dichotomous, for example,
"yes" or "no", "qualified" or "disqualified", et la..&nbsp; There are two
stable states and a transition between them, which is not stable and strongly
dependent on factor-level combinations.&nbsp; Such problems may be analyzed
with aid of logistic model:
<CENTER>log(<I>p</I>/(1-<I>p</I>)) = <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT></I><SUB>0</SUB>
+ <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT></I><SUB>1</SUB><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB> +
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT></I><SUB>2</SUB><I>x</I><SUB>2</SUB> + ...
+ <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT><SUB>n</SUB>x<SUB>n</SUB></I></CENTER>
where <I>p</I> is the estimate of the probability responding "yes", 1-<I>p</I>
"no" and <I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT></I><SUB>0</SUB>&nbsp; is intercept,
<I><FONT FACE="Symbol">b</FONT><SUB>i</SUB></I> ( <I>i </I>= 1, 2, ...,
n) is regression coefficient.
<BR><I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>x<SUB>n</SUB></I> like design matrix can
be given through uniform tables.&nbsp; Each run of the experiment produces
a value <I>p</I>, which is a proportion of the positive responses in subjects
of the run.&nbsp; In our context <I>x</I><SUB>1</SUB> - <I>x<SUB>n</SUB></I>
are random samples.&nbsp; Every run usually has 100-200 subjects.
<BR>A multi-center randomized clinical trial was adopted in the study.&nbsp;
1705 eligible women accepted the procedure of female tube sterilization
by chemical instillation. The 1705 examination papers are inputted with
the database of Visual Foxpro 5.0 in 586 computer and analyzed with SAS
6.04 to the 1667 examination papers that accorded with the requirements.&nbsp;
The article is carried on the Logistic regression of a single factor and
multi factors to analyze the given 12 factors that are related to succeed
of female tube sterilization by chemical instillation.&nbsp; The key factors
influencing contraceptive effect of the tube sterilization by chemical
instillation are in proper order: the film length of the occlusion by the
chemical reagents instilled into Fallopian tubes on a pelvic X-ray, the
type of chemical reagent, and the eligible woman's age.

<CENTER><B>Technology of Uniform Design and Parametric Optimization in
the Application of Petrochemical</B></CENTER>

<CENTER><I>Zhang Chengen</I></CENTER>


<P>The uniform design is first proposed by the Chinese mathematicians,
and is highly valued and promoted internationally.&nbsp; The Northeast
Pharmaceutics Co. and the China Petrochemicals Corp. together have popularized
the technology of Uniform design and parametric optimization.&nbsp; Some
improvements have been obtained after using this technology by different
units, such as the Fushun Research Institute of Petroleum and Petrochemicals,
Yanshan Petrochemical Corp., Qilu Petrochemical Co., and Shanghai Research
Institute of Petroleum and Petrochemicals.&nbsp; After the related conference
organized by the China Petrochemicals Corp. is held in Beijing, the usage
of uniform design increases immediately and becomes more popular.&nbsp;
It also helps for the development in the field of Petrochemicals.

With the development of market economy and the deepening of quality control,
more and more people have attached importance to the quality improvement
in the designing stage and the applications of the statistical design.
<BR>In early 1990s, we achieved remarkable success in introducing and spreading
the combined applications of homogeneous design and orthogonal design.
In the six scientific research items (in the laboratory) on antibiotics
introduced in this article, the increasing margin of unit reached over
20 percent. For example, in the experiment of optimizing the selecting
medium of penicillium-producing strain A#, the unit per milliliter was
raised by 29.27 percent, while the frequency of experiments was cut down
by 237 times. So the economic benefits and potential benefits are considerable.

The importance sampling is useful in higher dimensional integration.&nbsp;
Through the years, many of the adaptive importance sampling schemes are
proposed.&nbsp; In this paper, we generalized the idea of Oh's adaptive
scheme (1991) by introducing the weight function in each stages to get
similar results.&nbsp; The rate of convergence can be improved by adjust
the weight in each steps instead of using large sample size in the first
few stage.
